# ACM Research coding challenge (Fall 2022)

Note: if it's getting down to the deadline (September 5th at 11:59 CT) and you don't think you will be able to submit your project on time, just [submit](http://apply.acmutd.co/research-coding-challenge) whatever you have!

I apply the ACM research at 9/5, so I start the coding challenge in 9/5 even the due is 9/5.
There is a three graph in the notebook.

All three graph show the status for Electic, Hybrid, and Oil cars

First one is comparing price by year time mileage.
Everyone knows that the price of cars decreases as they get older.
The features directly related to this are mileage and year, which I simply multiplied by price.

The second is the distribution between year and price.

What you can see from the first and second graphs is that relatively recent cars are traded more than old cars. The closer you are to an electric vehicle, the more oil-consuming it is, the faster the price tends to drop.

The third graph is simply a boxplot. What we found in the 1st and 2nd can be substituted in the 3rd, but we cannot rule out the error that the overall price average has risen because there are many cars that have not been released for a long time. 

Apart from this, if you look at the outlier, there's something remarkable about the oil. You can see that there is a demand for classic cars that are expensive even though they are old.


I'll write down my ideas because I'm running out of time because I'm late to apply late. If I had one more day, I could make a model that tells me if it is a reasonable price when I buy a used car through year-price clustering using svm, and a program that helps me buy a used car by providing an average discount ratio next to it.
